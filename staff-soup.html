    <img src="./sanji-recipes/staff-soup.png" alt="A bowl of hot soup.">

    <h3>A Western-style soup made with sea bream and kombu kelp.</h3>

    <p><i>All of the Baratie cooks made a show of saying it was bad, but of course, it was perfect.
        It was Sanji's final piece of work on the Baratie Restaurant and the start of his send-off.
    </i></p>


    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sea bream head (300g)</li>
        <li>1 sheet kombu</li>
        <li>2 turnips</li>
        <li>6 asparagus pencil spears</li>
        <li>Half a lemon</li>
        <li>1,2L water, plus more to boil</li>
        <li>2 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>a little soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak kombu in water for at least 30 minutes, Slice the sea bream head into pieces if necessary,
            and place in a separate pot of boiling water deep enough to cover fish head.
            When the surface becomes white, remove and place in another bowl of cold water, then scrub clean
            to remove blood and stains
        </li>
        <li>Cut turnips into wedges and slice greens finely. Peel the bottom third of asparagus and slice into
            2 inch (5cm) pieces. Slice lemon into wheels.
        </li>
        <li>Pour water from step 1 and sea bream into same pot and bring to boil. Skim the scum off the top and 
            lower heat to medium. Add turnip wedges and let simmer, skimming regularly.
        </li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, add asparagus and simmer for 5 minutes. Add salt, and soy sauce to taste.
            Transfer to bowls, add lemon slices and scatter turnip greens on top.
