                            The first thing Sanji cooked once he joined the Strawhats. Luffy's order was "Meat on a bone!!"
                            And since then the classic chunk of meat on a bone it's an indispensable part of Luffy's journeys.

                    <h3>Steps:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make chicken drumstick "tulips". Use kitchen scissors to cut
                            the meat loose from the handle end of the drumstick. Roll the 
                            meat down the bone until it is fully inside-out at the end.
                        </li>
                        <li>Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Knead mix (a) in a bowl, then add breadcrumb
                            and knead again.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fold the meaty end of the drumstick around a hard-boiled egg. 
                            If the meat doesn't cover well enough, add cuts to loosen it up.
                            Oil hands lightly and cover drumstick and egg with step 2 breacrumb mixture.
                        </li>
                        <li>Bake at 200°C for 15-20 minutes, watching carefully.</li>
