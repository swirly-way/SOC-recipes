    <h3>The captain's favourite, one always at hand.</h3>


    <p><i>The first thing Sanji cooked once he joined the Strawhats. Luffy's order was "Meat on a bone!!"
        And since then it's an indispensable part of Luffy's adventures.
    </i></p>


    <h3>Ingredients (Serves 4):</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. milk</li>
        <li>Mix (a):
            <ul>
            <li>18 oz. (500g)ground chicken</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>a little black pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            </li></ul>
        </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make chicken drumstick "tulips". Use kitchen scissors to cut
            the meat loose from the handle end of the drumstick. Roll the 
            meat down the bone until it is fully inside-out at the end.
        </li>
        <li>Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Knead mix (a) in a bowl, then add breadcrumb
            and knead again.
        </li>
        <li>Fold the meaty end of the drumstick around a hard-boiled egg. 
            If the meat doesn't cover well enough, add cuts to loosen it up.
            Oil hands lightly and cover drumstick and egg with step 2 breacrumb mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Bake at 200°C for 15-20 minutes, watching carefully.</li>
    </ol>
